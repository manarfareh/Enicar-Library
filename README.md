I - General Introduction

1-Presentation of the general framework of the project: 
Java application for our university library management, itâ€™s a web-based system that allows
students and staff to access the library's resources from any device with an internet connection.

2-Subject presentation:
 The purpose of this project is to create a user-friendly and efficient library management system 
 that simplifies the borrowing and returning of books, as well as the tracking of library resources.

II - Analysis and Specification of Needs

1-Introduction:
 The analysis and specification of needs section provides a detailed overview of the functional and non-functional requirements of the application.

2-Identification of actors:
 The actors in this system include students, staff and  librarians.
